# Remote-Controlled-Fire-Fighting-Robot-using-ESP32
Developed a Bluetooth-controlled firefighting robot with flame sensors and a water-spraying system, enabling safe, real-time fire detection and suppression from a distance.A remote-controlled robotic system designed to detect and extinguish fires using Bluetooth communication. Equipped with flame sensors for fire detection and a water-spraying mechanism for suppression, the robot can be operated from a safe distance, reducing human risk in hazardous environments. The project demonstrates efficient fire-fighting capabilities with real-time remote navigation, making it suitable for industrial and residential safety applications.
